[OpenHistoricalMap](https://www.openhistoricalmap.org) is a sister project to OpenStreetMap, focused on mapping historical data around the world.
The website [includes a time slider](https://www.openhistoricalmap.org/#map=13/37.5273/-77.4366), allowing you to see what your area looked like at any point in history!

We are excited to promote OpenHistoricalMap usage and contributions in Richmond.
