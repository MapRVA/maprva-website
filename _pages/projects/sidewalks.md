The goal of this project is to develop a complete, up-to-date geospatial dataset of pedestrian infrastructure in Richmond on OpenStreetMap. This would help us work toward:
- Providing better pedestrian navigation using OpenStreetMap-powered apps like [AccessMap](https://www.accessmap.app), to help residents and tourists find their way around our city
- Building a deeper understanding of our infrastructure, allowing us to better advocate for its improvement
- Creating valuable data suitable for nuanced network analysis, and comparison with other well-mapped cities on OpenStreetMap 

## Progress

Our progress can be visualized on [our tasks page](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/projects/438/tasks), where you can click on "Contributions" to see estimated percent completion and a visual of which parts of the city we've mapped.

## Contributing

Any and all are welcome to contribute. If you are new to editing OpenStreetMap, please [get in touch with us](/contact/) and we'll be happy to get you going. If you are a seasoned mapper, please visit our [the tasks page](https://tasks.openstreetmap.us/projects/438/tasks) for detailed mapping instructions. Thank you for your help!
