The survey is still open [at this link](https://arcg.is/1if9O).

### Maximum Severity

This is a map of early survey results, where each cell is colored by the worst report in the cell. For example, if a cell contains a report of no water and a report of decreased pressure, it is colored as having no water (in red).
