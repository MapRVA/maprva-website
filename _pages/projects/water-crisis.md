It is not too late to take [our survey](https://arcg.is/1if9OT1)! Thank you for contributing to our project.

### Maximum Severity

This is a map of early survey results, where each cell is colored by the worst report in the cell.
EG: If a cell contains a report of no water and a report of decreased pressure, it is colored as
having no water(in red).
