Our group primarily communicates on Slack, in a workspace [hosted by OpenStreetMap US](https://openstreetmap.us/get-involved/slack/). Anyone is welcome to join our community and discuss mapping-related ideas with us.

Our channel is `#local-rva`, where conversation is focused on mapping activities in the Richmond area. There are many other channels available for mappers across the U.S., see [this page](https://openstreetmap.us/get-involved/slack/) for a list.

**When participating in this Slack workspace, please be mindful of the [OpenStreetMap US Code of Conduct](https://openstreetmap.us/code-of-conduct).**

For other ways to contact us, see our [Contact page](/contact).
