MapRVA is a group of mapping enthusiasts based in Richmond, VA.
We meet in-person every couple of weeks, and discuss potential and ongoing geospatial projects.
The venues for our meetings alternate between local breweries and libraries, for more social- and work-focused meetings, respectively.

## OpenStreetMap

Our work is generally focused on improving [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org) (OSM), a free database of geospatial information editable by anyone in the world.
By contributing data to OSM, we are enabling anyone to create high-quality routing or cartographic products of our city.

_Check out our page on the OSM Wiki [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia)!_

### Editing Guidelines

As a part of our OSM work in Richmond, we maintain [local editing guidelines](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Richmond,_Virginia/Tags) for our city.

## Join Us!

We welcome any and all to attend our meetings and/or collaborate with us.
Part of our mission is to be a resource to other residents of Richmond with regard to maps and GIS projects.
Please see [/contact](/contact) to get in touch!
